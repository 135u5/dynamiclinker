MANTIS Installation
===================
	The generic installation procedure as found in any distributed source project
can be used; nevertheless, it is convenient to make use of the 'autogen' shell
script. 'autogen.sh' can be found in the root directory of this distribution, and
its purpose is to automatically prepare the distribution directories in your own
local machine. 

	The steps required to be able to use the MANTIS w/ DynamicLinker distribution
are the following (assume <root> being the root directory of the project):
	(1) Run autogen script
		# cd <root>
		# sh ./autogen.sh
	(2) Configure TelosB module distribution
		# cd build/telosb
		# ./configure
	(3) Compile source code for TelosB module
		# ./make

	Notice that the compiled source code will be stored in '<root>/build/telosb'
directory, while the source code can be found in the '<root>/src' directory. In 
addition, the MOS development tools can be compiled from within the appropriate
directory.

	For any kind of information or requests, please contact the authors/maintainers
of the project, as found in the '<root>/AUTHORS' file.
