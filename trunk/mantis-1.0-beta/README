The DynamicLinker project (dynamiclinker) defines a suitable mechanism to 
dynamically add new functionalities to the sensore node. The project is based
on the MANTIS Operating System from the Computer Science research group at the
University of Colorado at Boulder (http://mantis.cs.colorado.edu).

Any question for the MANITS OS should be sent to the original developers at

	http://mantis.cs.colorado.edu/mailman/listinfo/mantis-users

while any question about the DynamicLinker extension should be sent to any of the
authors found in the <root>/AUTHORS file.
